2.5.1

- Fixes JavaScript and the Back button on the stats page when on HTTPS.


2.5.0

- **Big news!** Now you can configure Lessn More to generate random slugs of a desired length instead of incremental, guessable slugs. This means you will generate URLs like `/8RTvaN`, `/Nvb3QP` instead of `/a`, `/b`, `/c`, if desired.

- The link in LM's header now points to your main admin page,  and the update check info in the footer will always link to the LM project home page.


2.4.1

- Stopped checking for new versions of Lessn More whiled logged out, because it will always fail then.


2.4.0

- Users logging in over HTTPS will be authenticated with a cookie that will not leak out over HTTPS

- Cookies are now set with HTTP_ONLY, which means rogue JavaScript cannot steal your authentication cookie

- There is now a LOG OUT button

- Lessn More now checks for an updated version of itself whenever you use the web interface. (You still have to manually upgrade!)


2.3.0

- Lessn More will now return `http:` or `https:` short URLs to match
	the current protocol your server is responding to, by default.
	You can manually specify your preferred protocol in `config.php`.

- Lessn More lets you shrink non-Web URIs now, too, such as `ftp:` or `magnet:`.

2.2.0

- Better stats page.

- More compatible with sqlite (see [#7][]).

- Other small fixes and improvements.

- Supports a custom timezone in `config.php`.

- Special thanks to [Matt Wiebe](https://github.com/mattwiebe) for a lot of these changes.
